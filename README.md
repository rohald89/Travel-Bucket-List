# How to complete this Code Adventure! ðŸš€

### The Challenge

The provided mockups are for mobile (375px) and desktop (1440px) sized screens. You'll want to be coding this project using the mobile first approach so you'll want to start creating the mobile layout and using media queries make the styling behave differently when the screen size gets at a certain point.

- Mobile First
- Flexbox
- Pseudo Elements

### Extra Credits ðŸ”¥

There's a lot of different ways to accomplish this task. You can use any of the technologies you've used up to this point, I'd suggest to use this challenge to solidify what you've learned or maybe improve on some topics you're not completely comfortable with. Here are some examples of what you could add:

- Use Sass
- Add the content Dynamic using JavaScript
- Add some animations or transitions for example on hover for the "Read More"-link
- Create a grid with multiple cards
- Use [BEM](http://getbem.com/introduction/)

The possibilities are endless ðŸ˜Ž

Don't forget to share your end result over in Slack so we can learn from each others solutions!

Looking forward to see what you'll make of this!

Happy Coding! ðŸ’»
